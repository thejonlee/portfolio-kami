title: Coming to the end of Bloc
---
Can't believe the calendar has already flipped to March. College basketball conference tournaments are almost over, Selection Sunday is just two days away, and the end of my time in Bloc is rapidly approaching too.

I've learned a lot of things during the past several months in Bloc. Frontend and backend technologies, as well as things about myself and what I want to continue doing with my life moving forward.

My final two projects are Blocitoff, a backend app that allows users to create self-destructing to-do lists, and Open-To-Do, which is an external usable API for basic to-do lists. I have all your to-do lists needs covered.

More coming soon...
