title: Decision time
---
I thought about learning to code for a long time before joining Bloc. I dabbled a bit many years ago on Lynda.com, and learned very basic HTML to do some work for my job nearly a decade ago. I used Dreamweaver to translate text into code, but my learning never moved very far beyond that.

After hitting a wall in my career, I decided to join Bloc and give learning code and web development a full go. I'm looking forward to learning a lot of new languages like Ruby and Javascript and Javascript frameworks. So far it's been tough juggling studying with work and figuring things out like how to pay the bills and just life in general, but hopefully this new direction in my career will pay off down the line.
