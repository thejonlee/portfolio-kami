Hello! My name is Jonathan Lee. I am an experienced editor, writer, and content manager seeking a career in web development. I was born and raised in the greater Los Angeles area, and an alum of UCLA and the University of San Francisco. In the past, I’ve worked in a wide variety of roles including content creation, marketing, and product development with a specific focus in the sports industry.

Recently I’ve graduated from the Bloc online bootcamp and am looking to combine my past experiences and soft skills, and utilize them in the tech industry as a developer. My interests have always been varied, but today they converge on the intersection of content, technology, and sports.

Looking forward to connecting if you want to talk sports, technology, or the Los Angeles food scene.

Technologies and other skills: social media, marketing, writing, editing, content creation, blogging, web design and development, HTML, CSS, SASS, Bootstrap, Javascript, AngularJS, jQuery, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, APIs, Test Driven Development, Git and version control
